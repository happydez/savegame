# Bhop Savegame Plugin  
 
I wrote this plugin for my **LAN server** to allow the completion of long and hard maps like:  

- kz_bhop_genkai  
- kz_bhop_knothard  
- bhop_4matan  

This plugin is an imitation of the savegame plugin from the **FuckitHops** bhop server and is designed for **[Shavitâ€™s bhop timer](https://github.com/shavitush/bhoptimer)**.  
  
It works well on my **LAN server**, but I haven't tested it for potential issues. The current functionality is sufficient for me, but you are always welcome to **improve the plugin** so that it can be used on **public servers**.  

## Commands  
- `!restore`  
- `!pc`  
- `!savegame`
